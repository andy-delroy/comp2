The casinos in Las Vegas feel like people are not coming as much as they used to; they have a theory that it's because their games have gone stale. They have had the same games since forever! So they have come up with a new one.

This game is played on a N×NN×N square board, where each tile is colored white or black as in chess, such that the most common color on the board is white.

A player can come up and bet on the game; after that, NN pieces will be put at random on the board, such that no two pieces are on the same row or column. The player will get 1 dollar for each piece that is on a black tile and will lose a dollar for each piece that is on a white tile.

The casino has hired you to help them figure out what the expected amount of dollars they'll win is.

Standard input

In the first line, a number TT, the number of cases you'll answer.

On the next TT lines, a number NN, representing the size of the square board.

The first line of input contains an integer NN, the size of the chess board.

Standard output

Print TT lines. On each one, an integer, the expected number of dollars the casino will have to pay to a player, taken modulo 998244353998244353 (the answer can always be represented as an irreducible fraction a/ba/b, where bmod  998244353≠0bmod998244353=0. You have to print a⋅b−1mod  998244353a⋅b−1mod998244353).

For the second test case, N=2N=2 so there are two possible scenarios:

Where X is a chosen cell for the bet and . is an empty cell.

It's easy to notice that The first scenario gives an income of 22 while the second one gives a loss of 22. Since the sum of both scenarios is 00, the answer is 02=020​=0.

For the third test case, N=1N=1 so there is only one possible scenario with only a black cell, so the expected amount is 1111​
